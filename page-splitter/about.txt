> Split article/page content into chunks, and make it paginate-able.

You can use it to split long article/page content into two, three, four, or more steps. This plugin also useful for handling photo/video/presentation galleries or even web comics with a lot of images, so that the resource loading process can be lined up in steps.

Not recommended for text-only pages. It likely will only make your visitors get mad.

You **cannot** make more than one paginated article/page content in a single article/page content.

#### Usage

Add this HTML comment between the paragraph you want to split:

~~~ .html
<!-- next -->
~~~

##### Example 1

~~~ .html
I will become Page 1.

<!-- next -->

I will become Page 2.

<!-- next -->

I will become Page 3.
~~~

##### Example 2

~~~ .html
I will not be paginated.

<!-- begin:steps -->

I will become Page 1.

<!-- next -->

I will become Page 2.

<!-- next -->

I will become Page 3.

<!-- end:steps -->

I will not be paginated.
