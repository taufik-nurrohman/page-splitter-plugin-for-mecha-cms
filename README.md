Page Splitter Plugin for Mecha CMS
==================================

> Split an article/page content into chunks, and make it paginate-able.

You can use it to split long article/page content into two, three, four, or more steps. This plugin also useful for handling photo/video/presentation galleries or even web comics with a lot of images, so that the resource loading process can be queued in steps.

Not recommended for text-only pages. It likely will only make your visitors get mad.

Upload the `page-splitter` folder along with its contents through the plugin uploader. You need to compress the folder into a ZIP file to simplify the uploading process. After that, go to the plugin manager page and follow the instructions on the **About** tab.
